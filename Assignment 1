## Assigntment 1

## Task 1 - Answer the following questions
    # a. What is the medically relevant insight from the article?
    The current paper describes the transcriptional response to insulin in obese and non-obese individuals. 
    It shows that 78 genes were attenuated in the obese state compared with the non-obese state, thus "normalized" in the post-obese (PO) state. 
    The genes normalized in the PO state could be interesting to target as an attempt to improve the overall health of obese individuals.
    # b. Which genomics technology/ technologies were used?
    5' CAGE Profiling.

#  3. Further related research questions
    # a. List and explain at least three questions/ hypotheses you can think of that extend the analysis presented in the paper.
    1 - Does the WAT contain baseline (fasting) differences in genes expression in in the obese, post-obese state and never obese?
    2 - Which genes are most strongly correlated with the baseline characteristics such as free fatty acid levels, fat cell size, insulin
        both at baseline and in response to insulin?
    3 - Are the mitochondrial pathways impared in the obese state in response to insulin? 
        If so, are the same pathways normalized in the PO state or different in the never obese individuals?
    # b. [Optional] Devise a computational analysis strategy for (some of) the listed questions under 3a.
        By using the MitoCarta, one could isolate known mitochondrial proteins from the identified genes in the current dataset. 
        In a next step, one can perform a gene-set enrichment analysis of mitochondrial pathways, MitoPathways3.0 provided by the MitoCarta dataset.


## Task 2 - Git repositories and R Markdown

## Task 4

# 4.1
data("CO2")

# 4.2
?"CO2"
    # The CO2 data is a data frame with 84 rows and 5 columns. 
    # The data was collected in and experiment on the cold tolerance of the grass Echinochloa crus-galli.
    # The Co2 uptake was measured at several levels of ambient CO2 concentrations

# 4.3
CO2_results = as.data.frame(CO2 %>% # make a data frame called "CO2_results
  group_by(Type) %>% # divide the plants into two separate rows based on "type"
  summarise(meanUptake=mean(uptake), medianUptake=median(uptake), meanConc=mean(conc), medianConc=median(conc)) # summary statistics of mean & median
)

CO2_results # Prints the output
            # The plants from Quebec have a higher average CO2 uptaked than the plants from Mississippi

# 4.4 [Optional]


## Task 5

# 5.1 - The function "fun_ratio" calculates the ratio of mean / median
fun_ratio = function(x){
  mean(x) / median(x)
  }

y = c(1,2,3,10,0)

fun_ratio(y) # The ratio of the mean and median of our vector y equals 1.6. 
            # This was an exercise to write your own function. The function will save a lot of time in the long run as 
            # you only have to input the data and not do the entire calculations every time.

# 5.2 - Write a function that ignores the lowest and the highest value from a given vector and calculate the mean.
fun_NoExtremes = function(x) {
  if (length(x) < 3) { # The input needs to be at least 3 elements.
    stop("Vector must have at least 3 elements") # If less than 3 elements exist, the function will stop the analysis and print the text on this line.
  }
 
  sorted_x = sort(x)  # Sort vector in ascending order
  NoExtremes = sorted_x[-c(1, length(sorted_x))]  # Remove the lowest (first) and highest (last) values
  mean_value = mean(NoExtremes)  # Calculate the mean of the new vector
  return(mean_value)
}

fun_NoExtremes(y) # Removes the highest and lowest value in the vector "y" and calculates the mean of my vector. Mean = 2 when 0 and 10 is removed from the vector.
                  # This exercise taught me how to get rid of the first and last value of a list. It also challenged me to include a "stop" command in the code. 

# 5.3 - Write a short (max. 300 characters, no spaces) explanation of why, how, and when not to use pipes.
    # Pipes are good to use when you want to reduce excess intermediate steps in your code and to make it easier to read.
    # However, pipes should not be used if you have more than one input or output. One should also avoid pipes if you have
    # a lot of steps in your code, as it could make it harder to trouble shoot your code

# 5.4 - Write a short explanation the apply-family (max. 300 characters, no spaces) of why they could be useful in your work.
    # Apply functions streamline repetitive tasks by applying a function to each element or column in a data structure, 
    # this will enhance efficiency, save time and make sure the same  function is used for every column.
